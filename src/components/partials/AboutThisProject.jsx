        Welcome to our ecommerce platform! We used cutting-edge technologies like NodeJS, ExpressJS, ReactJS, MaterialUI, Tailwind, and MySQL to create a fast, scalable, efficient, and visually appealing platform. Our goal is to provide a secure and easy-to-use shopping experience for our customers. This platform is the final project of a 600+ hours coding bootcamp at Hack Academy, developed by a team of highly trained developers committed to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and emerging technologies.
